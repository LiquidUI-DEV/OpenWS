OpenWS Uploaded Scripts

This is where you can upload your scripts to be available to the WS Community.

Once uploaded, a Support Engineer will review the scripts to ensure they are up to standards.

Please include a file with your contact information so we can respond on whether or not your scripts 
have been approved for the Available Scripts directory.
